# LOBA Repository

This is a code repository application developed by Tomas Oliveira as part of a student internship at Loba.

## Overview

The application allows front-end developers to save and categorize code snippets with tags for easier searching. 
The project has four phases:

1. Gathering project requirements, creating use case diagrams, and designing a data model that supports the project's needs.

2. Documenting necessary interfaces, creating wireframes, and delivering them.
Documenting API endpoints and creating a mockup server using Postman.

3. Developing the frontend based on the wireframes created in phase two.

## Tools and Technologies used

1. React
2. Node 
3. MUI
4. Postman 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from Github / Bitbucket.

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command "npm install" in the root directory of the project.
